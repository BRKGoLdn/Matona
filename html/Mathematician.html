        <div class="info">
            <p>He was an ancient Greek mathematician. He is commonly referred to as the Father of Mathematics and is credited with developing modern mathematics. He created new methods for solving equations and comprehending geometric concepts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="info">
            <p> William Playfair, a Scottish engineer, was the founder of graphical statistics. Besides that signature accomplishment, he was at various times in his life a banker, an accountant, a journalist, an economist, and one of the men to storm the Bastille. </p>

            <h3> Thomas Bayes</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="info">
            <p>Thomas Bayes, a Presbyterian minister, laid the groundwork for Bayesian Statistics. Essentially, that interpretation of statistics looks into what can be said about an existing state given the results of a statistical test. Bayes' Theorem allows for the computation of conditional probabilities. Without getting into too much detail, that theorem is an essential concept in the field of predictive statistics.</p>

            <h3> Euclid</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="info">
            <p>Euclid, an ancient Greek mathematician alive during the reign of Ptolemy I in 323-283 BC, was the author of Elements, which served as the primary textbook for mathematics until the dawn of the 19th century. He originated Euclidean Geometry, and while perhaps not demonstrably responsible for the modern era, Euclid was certainly responsible for most of the elementary mathematics that led to it. Euclid was among the first to formalize mathematical proofs, the primary method of exposition for the discipline. </p>
